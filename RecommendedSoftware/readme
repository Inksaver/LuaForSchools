This section contains links to the recommended software for working with Lua.

You can use any text editor such as Notepad++, Atom, and many others, but using an IDE makes life easier.

I use ZeroBrane Studio from https://studio.zerobrane.com and there is a file in this section called user.lua which has my preferred settings stored in it.

To use this file:

1. start ZeroBraneStudio.
2. Menu: Edit --> Preferences --> Settings: system
3. Copy/Paste the contents of user.lua
4. Save
5. Restart

There are 3 colour choices on lines 41, 42, 43 with line 43 the current choice
To use another style, un-comment the line, and comment out line 43
Save and re-start
